## Hello there 👋
I'm lekan (lay-kon), a Computer Science student focusing on Software Engineering at UIC. I am a passionate developer, enthusiast of all things tech, and a nerd. 
I am a developer driven by a "how does it work?" mindset—constantly moving between high-level application logic and the low-level systems that power it.

### 🔭 What I'm working on
I love to bounce around between software domains, whether it's architecting a web app, optimizing a systems-level tool, or experimenting with hardware. I find that the best solutions usually come from understanding how these different worlds intersect. I am currently working on:

* [octo](https://github.com/l3k4n/octo): Building a custom browser engine from scratch, focusing on low-level rendering, networking primitives and being somewhat spec compliant.
* [harmony](https://github.com/l3k4n/harmony): Developing a centralized media management server with custom ui with support on all platforms.

### 📫 Where to reach me
You can reach me anytime on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/l3k4n), or through my [email](mailto:alowoojalekan@gmail.com).   
Got a new challen? I love being nerd-sniped by a good architectural puzzle or a low-level bug. If you’re working on something gnarly, reach out and let’s break it down.
